MFEprimer
=================

A fast and thermodynamics-based PCR primer specificity checking program

Introduction
-----------

MFEprimer [v2.0] is a program to help the biologist to check the primer specificity 
against the whole genomic DNA and mRNA/cDNA database easily and quickly. It uses the 
k-mer index algorithm to speed up the primer binding sites searching process, and 
uses the thermodynamics to evaluate the binding stability between the primer and DNA template.
Several important characteristics such as the sequence, melting temperature and 
size of each amplicon, either specific or non-specific, were reported in the result page. 
Based on these characteristics and the user-friendly output, users can easily draw a conclusion 
about the specificity of the PCR primers. Degenerate primers and multiple PCR primers analysis 
were also supported in MFEprimer-2.0. In addition, the supported database MFEprimer-2.0 is 
comprehensive, while the custom database is also supported upon userâ€™s request or use the
command-line version of MFEprimer-2.0. The MFEprimer-2.0 server is no login request and 
freely available at: http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/MFEprimer-2.0/.

Quick start
-----------

Web server: http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/MFEprimer-2.0/

Command-line: [download the latest release](https://github.com/quwubin/MFEprimer/zipball/master), 
usually named "quwubin-MFEprimer-XXXXXXX.zip".


System requirement
-----------

  * Linux, Mac (not test, but it should support)

  * Python (>= 2.7)

  * psutil: download from here (http://code.google.com/p/psutil/)

Installation and test
-----------

  1. `mv quwubin-MFEprimer-XXXXXXX.zip $HOME/local/`   # You can put it anywhere
  2. `cd $HOME/local/`  # Go the place
  3. `unzip quwubin-MFEprimer-XXXXXXX.zip`  # Unzip the file
  4. `mv quwubin-MFEprimer-XXXXXXX MFEprimer`  # Rename to normal MFEprimer
  5. `cd MFEprimer/test/`  # change to the test directory 
  6. `../IndexDb.sh test.rna`   # Index the database, it will create three files with suffix: .2bit .uni and .sqlite3.db.
  7. `../MFEprimer.py -i p.fa -d test.rna`   # Run MFEprimer and you will get the results if not errors found.
  8. Done. Good Luck.

Preparing the database
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Bootstrap will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
