{"name":"MFEprimer-2.0","body":"## Introduction\r\n\r\nEvaluating the specificity of PCR primers is an essential step in PCR primer design. The MFEprimer-2.0 server allows users to check primer specificity against genomic DNA and mRNA/cDNA sequence databases quickly and easily. MFEprimer-2.0 uses a k-mer index algorithm to accelerate the search process for primer binding sites and uses thermodynamics to evaluate binding stability between each primer and its DNA template. Several important characteristics such as the sequence, melting temperature and size of each amplicon, either specific or non-specific, are reported on the results page. Based on these characteristics and the user-friendly output, users can readily draw conclusions about the specificity of PCR primers. Analyses for degenerate primers and multiple PCR primers are also supported in MFEprimer-2.0. In addition, the databases supported by MFEprimer-2.0 are comprehensive, and custom databases can also be supported on request. The MFEprimer-2.0 server does not require a login and is freely available at http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/MFEprimer-2.0. \r\n\r\n## Who need a local version of MFEprimer?\r\n\r\nMFEprimer-2.0 has a web server version and a command-line version. [The web server host in our server](http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/MFEprimer-2.0/) may meet the need of most users. While in the following conditions, users may need a command-line version or a local mirror of MFEprimer-2.0 web server:\r\n\r\n  1. Private or custom database;\r\n  2. Limited Internet access;\r\n  3. Use MFEprimer-2.0 as a part of primer design software;\r\n  4. A lot of primers to be evaluated and the task is beyond our server capability. \r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\n  * Command-line: [download the latest release](https://github.com/quwubin/MFEprimer/zipball/master), \r\nusually named \"quwubin-MFEprimer-XXXXXXX.zip\".\r\n  * Local server (same as http://biocompute.bmi.ac.cn/CZlab/MFEprimer-2.0/): [download the latest release](https://github.com/quwubin/MFEprimerWeb/zipball/master), usually named \"quwubin-MFEprimerWeb-XXXXXXX.zip\".\r\n\r\n## Download and installation\r\n\r\n  Please reading the [Manual](https://github.com/quwubin/MFEprimer/wiki/Manual) for details.\r\n\r\n   \r\n## Bug tracker\r\n\r\nHave a bug?
